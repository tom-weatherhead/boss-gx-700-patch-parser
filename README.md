## History

The Boss GX-700 is a 1990s-era (pre-USB) guitar effects processor. It was first manufactured in 1996.

## Running the app

Use [SysEx Librarian](https://www.snoize.com/sysexlibrarian/) (or something similar) to receive, record, and play back the messages dumped from the GX-700.

To run the parser app, use Google Chrome (or something similar) to load the file src/index.html . The app may not work in Firefox because Firefox requires Web MIDI API calls to run within a secure environment.
